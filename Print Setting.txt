     To be fully 3d printable means that all the hardware can be printed off and included in .stl, (plastic hardware works.. But Please use metal hardware)

     I will add supports where needed no need to add support settings in slicer, i will include None support files if you want to use support.

     With Speed in Mind, i designed to print with a Nozzle (Tip of 1.0) ( Height 0.5) This makes print Time 2H for largest pieces.
     Adjust 
     For Smaller pieces use a Nozzle (Tip 0.5) (Height 0.2)

     Speed is What you can Do
