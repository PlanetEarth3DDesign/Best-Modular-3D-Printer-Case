The Best Design of the Modular Case For a 3D Printer

After I made a Frankenstein Monster of a 3D printer Case..
It Gave me time to thank about what should and should be done.

I learned tricks and skill as i built but all the ways i learned not to make something as well..   the next one will be better i keep saying.

Print Setting


To be fully 3d printable means that all the hardware can be printed off and included in .stl, (plastic hardware works But Please use metal hardware)

I will add supports where needed no need to add support settings in slicer, i will include None support files if you want to use support.

With Speed in Mind, i designed to print with a Nozzle (Tip of 1.0) ( Height 0.5) This makes print Time 2H for largest pieces.
Adjust 
For Smaller pieces use a Nozzle (Tip 0.5) (Height 0.2)

Speed is What you can Do
