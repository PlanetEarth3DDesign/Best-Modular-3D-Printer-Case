# Best-Modular-3D-Printer-Case
The Best Design of the Fully 3D Printable Modular Case For a 3D Printer!

After I made a Frankenstein Monster of a 3D printer Case..
It Gave me time to thank about what should and shouldn't be done.

I learned tricks and skill as i built but all the way's i learned how not to make something..   the next one will be better i kept saying.

When i realized i cant sell or even give Frankenstein's monster away i knew i had to rebuild.

I thought Good and hard about what i want and made a check list on what I want and the new one will have.

0. Fit any Printer!
1. Modular in design!
2. Fully 3d Printable!
3. Fast! No Supports!
4. Easy Upgrade!
5. Wire management!

Now with these in Mind i'm working with Gantry 3d Printer like Crealty Ender Series, or the AnyCubic Series. I will have Frame Specs posted in Photos and (Here)

     Print Setting
Print settings
     To be fully 3d printable means that all the hardware can be printed off and included in .stl, (plastic hardware works.. But Please use metal hardware)

     I will add supports where needed no need to add support settings in slicer, i will include None support files if you want to use support.

     With Speed in Mind, i designed to print with a Nozzle (Tip of 1.0) ( Height 0.5) This makes print Time 2H for largest pieces.
     Adjust 
     For Smaller pieces use a Nozzle (Tip 0.5) (Height 0.2)

     Speed is What you can Do

            (Cable chains work Best try my Mine)
        https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/cable-chain-anycubic-mega-zero-2-0

    6. Remove power supply, Cover & 80mm Fan 
    7. Remove Main Board, 40mm Fan
    8. Remove Raspberry Pi (If installed already)

    see Photos


2. Install Feet

    The Feet Are a Must put it raises the printer up but will all be used to get the space we want & also get the look of sleake, flush and seamless look

          Use M3 Bolts/T-Nuts/washers to Mount(see photos)

3. ReInstall Power-Supply/Main-Board/Raspberry-Pi
    
    Installing PSU Box Next To Main Box, will Reduce wires to control board. Shorten/Lengthen Cords as needed.
    Adding a extra box at the back of PSU will give extra space for Buck Controllers and USB, Hubs, LED, ext.

    1. Print Out Power Box A & B

        Power Box (A & B) Will fit ANY 12v/24v Power supply that comes with 3d printers.
        Heat set M2 Nuts for lid & PSU montings (see photos)

        The Fan bracket is made to ajust to the defront series PSU component location that may prevent you from mounting
        Line up fan mount to line up with lid. (If yours dose not line up!)
            (Use the closest hole and msg me for a free update)

8. Use the Spacer Box to Match you printer size if needed

The Flush Mount 3D Printable Case is now complete.


Time to start on the (Flush Mount platform) System
	The (Flush Mount Platforms) let you add a Flush Mount Platform all the way around a v-channel printer
	This is used to create the Complete 3D printable case

	The Main Platform Sould Be Reused to Go All The Wa Around 
	&
	A Spacer Platform Should Be Used To Fill/make up defronts batween printers
	
	Center Gantry Platforms are need to enclose build valume or for a flush look
	
	If spacer Dose Not Match printer Make a request

Time to start on the 3D printable Cover
	The Main Structure is V-slots that can be printed at 200mm High (recamend printing them off 1 at a time)

	-Work in Progress-
		Light waight V-slot option Print on side for faster and less plastic
	
	Secure base Munting Bracets to (Flush Mount Platform's / Flush Mount Boxes (see Photos)
	Add V-slots where needed (At Corners, The Door V-slots and the Back Wall)
	Add Middle Brackets & secure with M3 Hardware.
	Add 2nd Layer of V-slots

Mount top brackets
	Use V-slots to connect corner to corner.
	Mount The Center-Top Bracket's
	use V-slots to connect

	Check strctual integrity

	Walls/Panels
		Walls/panels will be secured with M3 hardware with T-Nuts (Working on possible printable alt.)
		
		
	This will prevent dust and keep your build valume stable
