The Best Design of the Modular Case For a 3D Printer

--Blog--

    When i got started in the 3D world i did not know where it would take me and im happy where it has taken me.
    From my 3d design to game design i have used the skills that started from getting my first 3d printer.
    So the adventure of moding and upgrading to get the best print but that was just the start.

    After a month of printer other peoples stuff the made i was ready to make something my self.
    
    I remembered all the stuff from High school about autocad and i ran with it, now im fluent and can make anything i want, but 2 years ago i could not.

    


    I would added Wire extenders and repined what was needed at this time
