# Best-Modular-3D-Printer-Case
The Best Design of the Modular Case For a 3D Printer

--Blog--

    When i got started in the 3D world i did not know where it would take me and im happy where it has taken me.
    From my 3d design to game design i have used the skills that started from getting my first 3d printer.
    So the adventure of moding and upgrading to get the best print but that was just the start.

    After a month of printer other peoples stuff the made i was ready to make something my self.
    
    I remembered all the stuff from High school about autocad and i ran with it, now im fluent and can make anything i want, but 2 years ago i could not.


--Theories--

The main theorie for this is not buying a box on amazon.
i want a box that i can get access to from all sides not so much the back.
i see boxes that dont let you get to what you need to.
Removing the hole box from the printer or a hole side panel dose not seam like something anyone wants to do.
After the first box i printed out i came up with a stile of doors on the front that worked Great with the flaws i plan on fixing.
After fixing and adding some latches and handles it will make it very accessable.
Exept i need to design it on the left and right side also keeping its structual integrity.
The best part about the Frankinstin monster is it was solid with no glue or screws.
so i want to keep the same integrity where a large handle on top can allow for moving of the hole printer.
The idea is a self sustained box.
I also want the top to hold multiple roles of filiment (1-10).
Have a insert wheel and beerings to lead and hold filemts ends for easy exchange.

A Main Idea for this Build is to have 5 main parts that are not dependent on the other.

    1. Upgrading  (Control Box & Power Box) w/o accessories
    2. Adding a flush mount Base w/o accessories
    3. Adding a Fully Printable Case w/o accessories
    4. Adding The (1-10) Fillament Role Holder
    5. Adding the Fillament Holder Top Flush Mount Box for Dust


--Placment Theories--

        Not Much of a theorie i know where i want stuff now lol



--Power Box Theories--
        the old box dose not alow air flow.
        Give the Box More Air.
        Leave room To run wires
        Flush Mount




--Main Box Theories--

    --Inserts Theories--
        The idea is so if you want to upgrade you just pill out the old insert and put in the new insert that matches your board or layout.
        This also helped with making designs easy to modularise.
        this allows the same box to be used any where.
        instead of printing defront boxes just print a thin sheat with hole placement

    --Buck connector Box Insert--
        The buck connector box will have to multiple layered to hold 6 of the large buck connectors with display
         or a single layer to hold 6-8 of the small buck connectors
        The idea of the buck conectors in there own box is to seporate the data from power as much as possible.
        having planty of room to cool, upgrade, or replace.
        would like to make insert to display buck connectors with display and labels 
         to open a box and see everything is steady and all connecters reading the same



--Structual Theories--

--Base--
    the idea is to have the base flush with the top of the 4040 v-slot.
    Also to have it go all the way around leaving a equal space on the left/right/front/back sides of the printer. (This allowes for the modular and any printer idea)
    Using the main Box modular design to add drawers and accessories to the front of the printer for structure.
    the power box and main box sit flush using the feet and top holes (for the not flush look us bottom holes on boxes the Heated Box Will not support this!)
    Taking the ideas from frankinstin i will use a platform with a support to structure out to designated location.
    will add the new system with T-Nut hole location to mount T-nuts, instead of having T-slot printed on box/supports

    The old box was not a box at all but it had the front left corner 45 degree between structures and gave a amazing look to the unused space.
    so the theorie is will i do something with the space?
    make the thing a box thats as smple to just print/repeat or ad a veriation?

    In the base you have the un used space under the Gantry Bed.
    Having the flush look was nice but i have had time to thank about what to put in its place
    For the logest tim i had no ideas what to put
    If you print it in clear or glow in the dark you can add LEDs and Get a cool affect with the flush look
    I also had Thoughts of a vacume system that after cleaning and scraping bed everything falls down and you can clean out with pan or a vacume attacment that sucks it out.


    so the theorie behind this is that the V-Slot Rails are strong and can actually be printed out fast and they are very strong
    i plan on taking these and using a little less then the max print hight design everything from.
    so you will be aboul to print out solid v-slot in just under (?h) with a (Tip ?) at (Hight ?)
    You will need (??) V-slots (???mm High) to complete the box

--Case Theories-- 
    The idea of the case is for Build temperature-control and keeping dust out.
    The case also helps with sound if you add acoustic foam.
    I have used mine for over a year now and has held up quite nice and has worked as expected.
    Adding a Fan-control with a temperature-control to the case will help make builds even more stable and act like a oven baking your print solid
    The locations of the fans are picked to allow proper I/O Cooling when needed (If you firmware-Board allows you to have this)

 or even have its own box attachment to hold multiple filiment roles.


    I would added Wire extenders and repined what was needed at this time
