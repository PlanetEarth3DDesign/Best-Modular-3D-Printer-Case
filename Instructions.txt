# Best-Modular-3D-Printer-Case
The Best Design of the Modular Case For a 3D Printer

Things Needed
    
    -M2- Nuts/Bults/washers
    -M3- Nuts/Bults/washers
    T-slot Thingivers
    Glue
    Stuff to Label wires Tape/Pin/ext
    Tools/ext
    Tools to Heat press Nuts
    Clean up Tools



1. Disassemble Printer

    1. Pre print Needed Components.

    2. Take Note to how your printer comes apart, label, & pictures as needed.

    3. Now is time to upgrade Other Components while you have the 3d printer apart.
        This Guide dose not cover those upgrades put supports them.

        Control Board upgrade
        BlTouch / Equivalent
        Hotend upgrade
        Stepper Motors upgrade
        Buck connecters
        20 Teeth pulley bore
        Filament Break Sensor
        Magnetic/Glass Build surface
        Heated Bed
        Cable Chains
        Extension Cable Kits for Creality
        Fan Upgrades 80mm & 40mm

    4. Move/Raise the Gantry to X Max & Z Max
    5. Adjust wires to reach Control board location
            (Cable chains work Best try my Mine)

    6. Remove power supply, Cover & 80mm Fan 
    7. Remove Main Board, 40mm Fan
    8. Remove Raspberry Pi (If installed already)
    9. Remove anything that may block or prevent install

2. Install Feet

    The Feet Are a Must put it raises the printer up but will all be used to get the space we want & also get the look of sleake, flush and seamless look

          Use M3 Bolts/T-Nuts/washers to Mount(see photos)

3. ReInstall Power-Supply/Main-Board/Raspberry-Pi
    
    Installing PSU Box Next To Main Box, will Reduce wires to control board. Shorten/Lengthen Cords as needed.
    Adding a extra box at the back of PSU will give extra space for Buck Controllers and USB, Hubs, LED, ext.

    1. Print Out Power Box A & B

        Power Box (A & B) Will fit ANY 12v/24v Power supply that comes with 3d printers.
        Heat set M2 Nuts for lid & PSU montings (see photos)
        Secure Box (A & B) with M2 Bolt/Nuts 1,2.
        Place Power supply in Box (A & B) and secure 3,4,5 with M2 Bolt/Nut/washers.

   2.  Install Fan into (Power Supply Bracket).
       
        The Fan bracket is made to ajust to the defront series PSU component location that may prevent you from mounting
        Line up fan mount to line up with lid. (If yours dose not line up!)
            (Use the closest hole and msg me for a free update)
        Set Fan so Hot air is Being Pulling away from Board.
        Reuse old hardware

    3.Install Fan Brakecket to hole 6. (see photo)
        
    4. install Main Power I/O switch in proper location

        Use M3 Bolts/T-Nuts/washers to Mount(see photos)

        
4. Main Box
            The Main Box can be used for moduler parts.
            Heat set M2 Nuts for lid.
            The Main Box Fits All Main Control Boards of 3d printers.
            The Main Box Also Fits All Raspberry Pi' Series.
            Use M3 Bolts/T-Nuts/washers to Mount (see photos)

        Box Inserts
            Pick the Insert that matches your Needs.
            Print Faceplates that are needed.
            Heat set M2 Nuts.
            Install Faceplates.
            Glue Insert in place after Matching to faceplate.


5. Rewire
        Hook everything back up how it was or if you add extinders or redused wire good luck


4. Print Lids as needed(Work in Progress)
    Screw down with m2 Washers/Nuts
    Hook up cable chains

Flush mount main board system is now complete.

Time to start on the 3D printer Cover
