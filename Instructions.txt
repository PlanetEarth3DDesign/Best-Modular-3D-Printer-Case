    Clean up Tools



1. Disassemble Printer

    1. Pre print Needed Components.

    2. Take Note to how your printer comes apart, label, & pictures as needed.

    3. Now is time to upgrade Other Components while you have the 3d printer apart.
        This Guide dose not cover those upgrades put supports them.

        Control Board upgrade
        BlTouch / Equivalent
        Hotend upgrade
        Stepper Motors upgrade
        Buck connecters
        20 Teeth pulley bore
        Filament Break Sensor
        Magnetic/Glass Build surface
        Heated Bed
        Cable Chains
        Extension Cable Kits for Creality
        Fan Upgrades 80mm & 40mm

    4. Move/Raise the Gantry to X Max & Z Max
    5. Adjust wires to reach Control board location
            (Cable chains work Best try my Mine)

    6. Remove power supply, Cover & 80mm Fan 
    7. Remove Main Board, 40mm Fan
    8. Remove Raspberry Pi (If installed already)
    9. Remove anything that may block or prevent install

2. Install Feet

    The Feet Are a Must put it raises the printer up but will all be used to get the space we want & also get the look of sleake, flush and seamless look

          Use M3 Bolts/T-Nuts/washers to Mount(see photos)

3. ReInstall Power-Supply/Main-Board/Raspberry-Pi
    
    Installing PSU Box Next To Main Box, will Reduce wires to control board. Shorten/Lengthen Cords as needed.
    Adding a extra box at the back of PSU will give extra space for Buck Controllers and USB, Hubs, LED, ext.

    1. Print Out Power Box A & B

        Power Box (A & B) Will fit ANY 12v/24v Power supply that comes with 3d printers.
        Heat set M2 Nuts for lid & PSU montings (see photos)
        Secure Box (A & B) with M2 Bolt/Nuts 1,2.
        Place Power supply in Box (A & B) and secure 3,4,5 with M2 Bolt/Nut/washers.

   2.  Install Fan into (Power Supply Bracket).
       
        The Fan bracket is made to ajust to the defront series PSU component location that may prevent you from mounting
        Line up fan mount to line up with lid. (If yours dose not line up!)
            (Use the closest hole and msg me for a free update)
        Set Fan so Hot air is Being Pulling away from Board.
        Reuse old hardware

    3.Install Fan Brakecket to hole 6. (see photo)
        
    4. install Main Power I/O switch in proper location

        Use M3 Bolts/T-Nuts/washers to Mount(see photos)

        
4. Main Box
            The Main Box can be used for moduler parts.
            Heat set M2 Nuts for lid.
            The Main Box Fits All Main Control Boards of 3d printers.
            The Main Box Also Fits All Raspberry Pi' Series.
            Use M3 Bolts/T-Nuts/washers to Mount Box to frame where needed (see photos)

        Box Inserts
            Pick the Insert that matches your Needs.
			Main Board
			Pi
			Buck Connector
			LED/RGB
			Fans
			(On request)
		Heat set M2 Nuts into needed insert.
		Glue Insert in place after Matching to faceplate. -Recomended do this last- (You mite want to move stuff around and choose another layout)

      Print Faceplates that are needed.
	I have included Faceplates for alot of extras
		Fans
		usb's
		HDMI
		ethernet port
		main board
		pi's
		Air Holes
		Solid
		(On request)
      Install Faceplates.
	Use M2 Bolts/washers/nuts to Mount(see photos)

5. Secure all boxes and faceplates together with M2 Boltt/washers/nuts

6. Rewire
        Hook everything back up how it was or if you add extinders or redused wire good luck thats up to you

7. Print Lids as needed
	Choose the lid that fits your needs, cable chain, blank, Air Holes, Fan
    Screw down with m2 Washers/Nuts
    Hook up cable chains

8. Use the Spacer Box to Match you printer size if needed

The Flush Mount 3D Printable Case is now complete.


Time to start on the (Flush Mount platform) System
	The (Flush Mount Platforms) let you add a Flush Mount Platform all the way around a v-channel printer
	This is used to create the Complete 3D printable case

	The Main Platform Sould Be Reused to Go All The Wa Around 
	&
	A Spacer Platform Should Be Used To Fill/make up defronts batween printers
	
	Center Gantry Platforms are need to enclose build valume or for a flush look
	
	If spacer Dose Not Match printer Make a request

Time to start on the 3D printable Cover
	The Main Structure is V-slots that can be printed at 200mm High (recamend printing them off 1 at a time)

	-Work in Progress-
		Light waight V-slot option Print on side for faster and less plastic
	
	Secure base Munting Bracets to (Flush Mount Platform's / Flush Mount Boxes (see Photos)
	Add V-slots where needed (At Corners, The Door V-slots and the Back Wall)
	Add Middle Brackets & secure with M3 Hardware.
	Add 2nd Layer of V-slots

Mount top brackets
	Use V-slots to connect corner to corner.
	Mount The Center-Top Bracket's
	use V-slots to connect

	Check strctual integrity

	Walls/Panels
		Walls/panels will be secured with M3 hardware with T-Nuts (Working on possible printable alt.)
		
		
	This will prevent dust and keep your build valume stable
